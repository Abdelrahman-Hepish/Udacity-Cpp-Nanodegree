/* 
Previously, you wrote the most basic program that will compile in C++: a simple main(). In this exercise, you will modify that program to print output to the terminal. Don't forget that you can compile and run your program with the following two steps from the command line:

    g++ main.cpp
    ./a.out

To Complete This Exercise:

        Add code to the main.cpp file below to print "Hello!" using cout.

*/
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
  // TODO: Add your code here:
  cout<<"Hello!\n" ; 
  
}
